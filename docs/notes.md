1. we are crashing services after we encounter too many failures; we should never crash them
2. you added integration tests for the infra which is fine, but I want to have integration tests for the services themselves!! for example, data-persistence should test integration with ClickHouse, file-processor with minio, normalizer with redis, everything that uses postgres with postgres ect
3. we need to wrap database interactions with observability. Ideally, we can identify each call based on what line of service/module code interacts with it and have 50 95 and 99 percentile mentrics
